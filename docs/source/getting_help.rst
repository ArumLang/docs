Getting Help
============
Although we do our best to be as clear as possible in the documentation,
it is inevitable that some questions will be left unanswered. If you
need help in any way, we have several channels for that purpose.

Discord
-------
The `Discord server <https://discord.gg/gCGmraBRQ8>`_ is also a place
to ask questions or discuss the mod. Given the more immediate nature
of Discord as opposed to Reddit, it is more suited to very short
questions that take less time to answer, or just general back-and-forth
discussion about the mod.

Github Issues
-------------
If you find a bug, have a general question about the project, or want
to contribute to the project, you can open an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/JERScript/JERscript/issues>`_.

**JERScript** (/j.e.r'skript/) is a minimalist scripting language for scripters
that is ran very fast.

**JERScript** is a scripting language you write in!
It was made in `node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_
and offers a welcoming and linear learning curve.

*Side note: A lot of this stuff is a work in progress, or either copied from the KOS documentation, check them out!*
